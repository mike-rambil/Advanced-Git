## Latest Finds

- `git push --force-with-lease` - [Cancels git push if someone else did a commit on the same remote branch and safe guards `git push`](https://medium.com/@sahilsahilbhatia/git-push-force-with-lease-vs-force-ecae72601e80)
- `git maintenance start` - [Runs a cronJob in background for the specified repo for periodic maintanence](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-maintenance)

## 📌 `git push --force-with-lease`

`git push --force-with-lease` ensures you don’t accidentally overwrite someone else’s work when force-pushing. It checks if the remote branch still matches what you last pulled. If someone else has pushed changes in the meantime, your push is rejected, preventing unintended data loss.

### 🔹 Problem

When users are within the same branch and they want to push to remote but not sure if there is a commit pushed from the other dev that might block you

### 🔹 Solution

use the ---force with lease flag while pushing to check it there is a push. If there is a push from the other person - your push to the same branch is cancelled.

## 📌 Git Worktree Tutorial

### 🔹 Problem

Switching branches in Git can be slow and disruptive, causing frequent IDE reconfigurations and delays.

### 🔹 Solution

Git Worktree allows you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without the overhead of constant switching and reconfiguration.

# Delete Untracked Files and Folders

To delete untracked files and folders, use the following methods:

Git provides `git clean` to safely remove **untracked files and directories**.

### 1️⃣ Dry Run (Check What Will Be Deleted)

First, run this to see what will be deleted:

```bash
git clean -n -d
```

### 2️⃣ Delete Untracked Files and Folders

If everything looks correct, run:

```bash
git clean -f -d
```

What this does:
-f → Forces deletion of untracked files.
-d → Deletes untracked directories (like data-loader/).

<h2 id="git-log-oneline-filename-txt"><code>git log --oneline -- filename.txt`</code></h2>

`git log --oneline -- filename.txt` shows all past commits that changed a specific file (filename.txt) in a short and easy-to-read format.


<h3 id="git-log-oneline-filename-txt-PROBLEM">🔹 Problem</h3>

When users want to see past commits of a specific file to either revert back a commit/cherrypick/review etc.

<h3 id="git-log-oneline-filename-txt-SOLUTION">🔹 Solution</h3>

use the `git log --oneline -- filename.txt` to review the past commits and view the differences. Users can then subsequently revert, reset, review and do whatever makes sense with that commit of the specific file.
